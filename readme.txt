## Known limitations

* Links to documentation to resolve reported issues are shown to PRO ISP AS customers only.
* This plugin will probably not report much if the site is not on a cPanel¬Æ managed server, but will do the test for HTTPS only.
* This plugin was originally written for **PHP 7.4** (recommended) and later, and for WordPress 5.2 (Site Health introduced) and later. It's namespaced, has static classes and uses typed class properties. Also available for PHP 7.2, since typed properties are removed in this wporg edition.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin add database tables, store options or adding lines to ¬¥wp-config.php¬¥? =

No, not, none.

= Does it require my login information to cPanel¬Æ? =

No.

= Does it work on other web hosts than PRO ISP? =

Yes, at least on some, but not tested much. Please report your experience. Use Reviews, Support or GitHub.

= Does it work without cPanel¬Æ? =

Very, very limited. The 'HTTPS only' security test should work, and disk used info, but max space test will not be performed and the result will just show 'N/A'.

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =

Yes, visit it's [Github repo](https://github.com/Nettvendt/wf-cpanel-right-now-site-health) and create an issue, clone it and/or file a pull request.
