"In internet services providing (ISPs) or pure web hosting, disk space is the "
"amount of space actually used or available on the server for storing the "
"content of your site. This content includes posts, pages, images, videos, "
"logs, other files, preferences, settings, configurations, and whatever else "
"stored on as files or in databases. In case a full ISP, it is also used to "
"store emails, including their full content and attachments. The amount of "
"used disk space tend to grow over time.</p><p>The maximum amount depend on "
"the subscribed package or plan typically from 1GB to over 100GB. When your "
"available disk space is exhausted, your site may break or fail in strange, "
"unpredictable ways. Deleting redundant temporary files and oher \"garbage\" "
"may rectify it short term. Upgrading your plan/package/account is a more "
"sustainable solution.</p><p>Disk space used is %1$s out of %2$s available. "
"Your uploaded media files takes up %3$s."

"You should ensure that visitors to your web site always use a secure "
"connection. When visitors use an insecure connection it can be because used "
"an old link or bookmark, or just typed in the domain. Using https instead of "
"https means that communications between your browser and a website is "
"encrypted via the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security). Even if your "
"website doesn't handle sensitive data, it's a good idea to make sure your "
"website always loads securely over https. This situation can and should be "
